"""A :class:`~twinkle.sampler.Sampler` on plain transformers ``generate()``.

Drop-in for :class:`~twinkle.sampler.vLLMSampler`: same constructor shape
(``model_id, engine_args, device_mesh``), same ``sample`` / ``sample_stream`` / ``shutdown`` surface,
same synchronous-blocking convention. Swapping backends should not require touching call sites.

Two capabilities exist here that the vLLM path does not have:

- ``strict=False`` degrades **per input** instead of failing the batch. Offline sampling over a large
  corpus routinely hits a handful of rows that cannot be encoded (over-length, broken media refs); the
  legacy sampler set ``engine.strict = False`` for exactly this, and losing it would mean one bad row
  discards a whole run's worth of work.
- batching is explicit. transformers has no continuous batching, so inputs are grouped and padded up
  front by the engine's ``batch_sample``.

Not provided, deliberately: colocated weight sync. ``vLLMSampler`` mixes in ``CheckpointEngineMixin``
to receive NCCL-broadcast weights mid-training; this backend is for inference, evaluation and offline
sampling, and a half-working ``receive_weights`` would be worse than an absent one. ``update_weights``
on the engine covers the simple in-process refresh.

And not needed, in the one case where it would otherwise be: passing ``model=<TransformersModel>``
instead of ``model_id`` makes this a facade over a model that already exists, generating inside its
workers. Nothing is loaded and nothing is synced, because there is only ever one set of weights.

                below is a ``TransformersModel`` whose workers do the generating. Both avoid a reload;
                the first is what ``TransformersModel.generate`` uses internally.
            device_mesh: Data-parallel layout. Slicing is done by ``dispatch='slice_dp'`` on

                needs no workers of its own, and the model's ``generate`` does the data-rank slicing.
